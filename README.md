# Regex Tutorial

## Description

As a developer, I will not only write code but also write about code. In this challenge, I have created a tutorial that explains how a specific regular expression, or regex, functions. I have broken down each part of the expression and described what it does. e.g: `/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/i`

## Summary

I will explain each of these components in detail, so you can understand how they contribute to the overall regex pattern. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a solid understanding of regular expressions and be able to use them effectively in your code.
